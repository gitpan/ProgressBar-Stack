NAME
       ProgressBar::Stack - Progress bar implementation with stack support and
       useful loop wrappers

DESCRIPTION
       "ProgressBar::Stack" creates a convenient framework for adding progress
       bars to long processes.  Sometimes you have long process which consists
       of several subprocesses, some of which have cycles (including nested
       ones), some called several times and so on. If you want to display con-
       tinuous progress bar from 0% to 100% for such complex process, you will
       have bad times calculating current percentage for each subprocess.
       "ProgressBar::Stack" does much of dirty work for you.

       There are two interfaces provided: one object-oriented, the other
       don't. Non-OO interface actually creates single object and delegates
       all calls to it. Practically using non-OO interface is enough in many
       cases, especially taking into account that different threads will have
       independent progress bars, but for some windowed applications several
       progress bars might be necessary.
